## interesting facts
#### 1. the first commune was made on july 20, 2023, but i began to write on July 18, so this day will be considered the date of founding
#### 2. v0.0.1 was written in 3 days
#### 3. the original name was `plsh`, but i thought that it was just terrible and i just scored japanese words with sh in google, but when i entered it into an translator from english, it turned out very surprisingly :), so i came to the fact that there is now there
#### 4. i always write with a small letter (with the exception of some cases), since I want to express the "miniature" of my projects

##### the next fact will be soon (i'm not sure)
